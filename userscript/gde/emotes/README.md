### Glossary
This glossary contains my own definition of some of these words. Most of these words only have this meaning on this project.

**Group:** Collection of emotes from the same source. E.g. TwitchTV, Better TwitchTV, _give dem emotes_

**Zero-Width emote:** Emotes that overlap other emotes, more information below.

**Code (of an emote):** Also called Regexp/RegExp, it's the "name" of the emote, the text used to represent it. E.g. Kappa, LUL, PANTSU

**Endpoint:** Term used to refer to the URL used to fetch a resource from the internet, the _end point_ of an API. E.g. the URL of any of _give dem emotes_ supported group's API. 

**Emoji:** Image that represents a face expression/object/country/etc., basically every emoji on any emoji pack. These images are already converted in most (if not all) of the sites _give dem emotes_ can run on.

**Emote:** Image linked to a code that represents basically anything at this point (like c'mon, people make emotes for everything!). These emotes are normally only added by _give dem emotes_ on the sites it supports.

### FAQ
#### What are Zero-Width emotes?
`zero-width` emotes are one's that don't actually occupy space, but are overlapped on other emotes (like SantaHat)

| ![:Kappa:SantaHat:](../readme-resources/zero-width_1.jpeg) |
|:----------------------------------------------------------:|
|                     `:Kappa:SantaHat:`                     |

The emotes have to be next to each other, or else they will appear separated:

| ![:Kappa: :SantaHat:](../readme-resources/zero-width_2.jpeg) |
|:------------------------------------------------------------:|
|                    `:Kappa: :HalloHalo:`                     |

And yes, you can stack them!

| ![:Kappa:SantaHat:HalloHalo:](../readme-resources/zero-width_3.jpeg) |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|                     `:Kappa:SantaHat:HalloHalo:`                     |

#### What are the emotes with a hyphen (`-`) and a number after their code?
While fetching the emotes, _give dem emotes_ lower-cases their code. This allows for typing `:Kappa:`, `:kappa:` or `:kAppA:` and still get the same result.

Problem comes when on an endpoint they are multiple emotes who's code, when lower-cased, is the same.

To solve this problem, if there is already an emote with the lower-cased code registered on the same group, _give dem emotes_ adds a "-<number>" after it.

#### I want to use a certain emote, but another emote appears
This is probably because another group has an emote with the same code lower-cased. In that case, use `:group>code:` instead of just `:code:`.

If the problem persists, then you should consider [requesting the emote](#requesting-emotes)


### Requesting emotes
#### Files
[`api_custom.json`](api_custom.json) and [`api_extra.json`](api_extra.json) are the files storing _give dem emotes_'s emotes and some extra emotes respectively.

If the emote should have more than one code, then separate them with a vertical line (`|`).
E.g. "yeahsure|yeasure" will make `:yeahsure:` and `:yeasure:` render the same emote.

The longest code should be first, to follow (a made up) convention.

##### `api_custom.json`
This file contains all emotes under the "gde" or group.
It's format is the emotes codes, separated by extension:  
```js
{
  "<extension>": [
    "<code(s)>",
    //...
  ],
  //...
}
```

The image path is determined by the code (or first code, in case of multiple) + a dot + the extension:

|                   JSON                  |      Image path     |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
|           `"gif": [ "Emote" ]`          |     "Emote.gif"     |
| `"png": [ "MultipleEmote|MultiEmote" ]` | "MultipleEmote.png" |

#### `api_extra.json`
This file contains additional emotes that are not found on other APIs.
It's format is the emotes codes set to it data, separated by group, separated by type (normal or zero-width)

```js
{
    "<type>": {
        "<group>": {
            "<code(s)>": DATA
        },
        //...
    },
    //...
}
```

where...

|       Group       | `DATA` is | Where to get it | Example |
|:-----------------:| --------- | --------------- | ------- |
|      TwitchTV     | Emote's ID | [twitchemotes.com](https://twitchemotes.com/). Use the top left bar to find the emote you want and click on it to go to it's page, the ID should be the numbers at the end of the URL. | `"KappaRoss": "70433"`
|  Better TwitchTV  | Emote's ID | [manage.betterttv.net](https://manage.betterttv.net/emotes/share/). Connect your TwitchTV account, go to the bottom of the page, find the emote and click on it to go to it's page, the ID should be the text at the end of the URL. | `"tf": "54fa8f1401e468494b85b537"`
|      TastyCat     | Emote's image URL | [emotes.tastycat.org](https://emotes.tastycat.org/). Find the emote you want, right click it's image and press "Copy image address". | `"NyanCat": "https://emotes.tastycat.org/emotes/cats/NyanCat.gif"`
|        RCS        | Emote's image file name | [rcs.radiant.dj/emotes](https://rcs.radiant.dj/emotes). The file name is usually the emote's code plus the extension ".png", or ".gif" if it's animated. | `"1up": "1up.png"`, `"portal": "portal.gif"`
|    FrankerFaceZ   | Emote's ID | [frankerfacez.com/emoticons/](https://www.frankerfacez.com/emoticons/). Use the bar on the left to find the emote you want and click on it's name, the ID should be the numbers at the end of the URL (without the "-emote's code" part). | `"OhMyDood": "89824"`
|     DeviantArt    | Emote's image object â†’ `subdomain` and `path` | [DeviantArt's emoticons section](https://www.deviantart.com/browse/all/customization/emoticons/animated/). Make sure the sizes are at least in Medium. Right click on the emote's image, open in a new tab, and get the `DATA` from the URL as is: http://**SUBDOMAIN**.deviantart.net/**PATH** | `{ "subdomain": (REDACTED), "path": (REDACTED) }`

**Note 1:** For _give dem emotes_ emotes, please refer to [`api_custom.json`](#api_custom_json)

##### Zero-Width emotes are special....

- They can only be from TwitchTV and Better TwitchTV.
- Sometimes, their `DATA` is not simply a string of characters or number.

Zero-Width emotes support objects:
```js
DATA: {
    id: ID,
    isHat: true // emote should be "pushed to the top a little"
}
```

#### Size
On custom emotes, the image must be at least 200 pixels in width and/or height. E.g. 200x200, 200x199, 199x200.

Also, no extra transparent space should be on the image.

#### How to
- Check if the emote is already on _give dem emotes_
- Fork this repository.
- If the emote is custom (_give dem emotes_)...
    - Add the image to this folder (`/userscript/gde/emotes/`) and add the emote
- Go to the JSON file and add the emote at the bottom of the group.
- Create a Pull Request
    - The title should be "New emote for `<group>`: `<code>`"
    - Make sure to give credit to the author of the image, in case it wasn't you

Example of file with new emote
`api_custom.json`
```js
{
    //... other extensions,
    "<extension>": {
        "<emote code>",
        // or
        "<another emote's code>|<another emote's code variant>|<...>"
    }
}
```

`api_extra.json`
```js
{
    "normal": {
        "twitchtv": {
            "<emote code>": <data>
        },
        //... other groups
        "deviantart": {
            "<another emote's code>" {

                "path": <path>
            }
        }
    },
    "zero-width": {
        //... other groups
        "bettertwitchtv": {
            "<emote code>": "<ID>",
            // or
            "<another emote's code>": {
                id: "<ID>",
                isHat: true
            }
        }
    },
    //... other types, maybe
}
