dte-lite:
    Old script I was working on to kinda replace DubX, not being developed anymore.
    Probably will give you errors when try running it.

messageonmute:
    Simple script that inserts a message in chat when someone is muted. Making mutes not so silent.

propscmd:
    Introduces /props, which just sends a message from a customizable random list.
    Originally intended to mention the current DJ to prop they for the song.
    Only works in room chat (obviously).

##### Other scripts not here:

[_give dem emotes_](https://cloudy-netux.rhcloud.com/dubtrack/give-dem-emotes):
    Replaces named emotes (the ones inside `:these:`) with the actual image.
    Supports TwitchTV, BetterTwitchTV, TastyCat (DubX GitHub Repository host) and FrankerFaceZ (BetterDiscord GitHub Repository host)
    Works anywhere where emojis are replaced (`:D`, `;)`, etc)

[image replacer](https://cloudy-netux.rhcloud.com/dubtrack/image-replacer):
    Replaced a few named emotes (the ones inside `these`) with the actual image.
    The main difference with _give dem emotes_ is that this one replaces the image **before sending the message**, and with the actual link of the image whereas _give dem emotes_ replaces the text when receiving the message.
    Only works in room chat.

[RECMSG](https://cloudy-netux.rhcloud.com/dubtrack/RECMSG):
    Records every message sent in room chat and allows them to be shown after they are removed.
    Only works in room chat.
